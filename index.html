  <h2>N i r v a n a</h2>
  <p class="nir">Nirvana are one of the biggest and most influential bands in music history. Formed in Seattle in 1987, they pretty much single-handedly catapulted alternative music into the mainstream when their second album, Nevermind, took the music industry by surprise and turned popular culture on its head on its release in 1991. Their mix of dirgey, down-tuned rock’n’roll, punk rock spirit and abstract lyrics originally captured the imagination of the increasingly disaffected Generation X youth, but continues to shape and inform rock music today.
 But who are Nirvana? How did they start out? What are their biggest songs? We bring you everything you need to know about Seattle’s favourite sons.</p>

<h3>What is the meaning of Nirvana in Buddhism?</h3>
<p>
  The term nirvana in Buddhism is most commonly used to refer to the religion’s ultimate spiritual goal of attaining a state of enlightenment which releases one from the cycle of reincarnation. The term refers to the extinguishing of three fires within the self, each of which represents greed, hatred and delusion, so that one can reach peace and spiritual fulfilment. Modern interpretations suggest a “nirvana in this life” is possible dependent on a “transformed state of personality characterised by compassion, peace, deep spiritual joy and an absence of negative mental states and emotions such as doubt, worry, anxiety and fear”.
